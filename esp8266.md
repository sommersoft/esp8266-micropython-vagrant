# ESP8266 & CircuitPython SDK Virtual Machine
Vagrant file to build a virtual machine that can compile the [ESP8266 open SDK](https://github.com/pfalcon/esp-open-sdk) &amp; 
[CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython) firmware.

Note that CircuitPython support for the ESP8266 closely tracks MicroPython, but
does not support the full capabilities of other MicroPython boards.  However 
this VM will help make it easy to build and install CircuitPython for the
ESP8266 to test it out and even contribute to it.

Many thanks to the contributors of ESP open SDK & MicroPython for making
their excellent software available!

# Dependencies

You must have the following software installed:

*  [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
*  [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)

# Usage

Clone this repository and navigate to it in a command terminal, then run the
following command to bring the Vagrant virtual machine up and provision it for
compiling the tools:

    vagrant up

After the virtual machine is brought up and provisioned use the following
command to enter an SSH session on it:

    vagrant ssh

Once inside the virtual machine you will see two git repositories that have
already been cloned:

*   [esp-open-sdk](https://github.com/pfalcon/esp-open-sdk) - This is an SDK to
    compile code for the ESP8266's processor.
    
*   [circuitpython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython) - This is the CircuitPython
    SDK which allows running embedded Python code on an ESP8266.  The only ESP8266 currently
    supported by CircuitPython is the [Adafruit Feather HUZZAH](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2821).

## ESP Open SDK Compilation

You will want to first compile the ESP open SDK by executing (note that the
compilation will take about 30 minutes to an hour or more depending on the speed
of your machine):

    cd esp-open-sdk
    make STANDALONE=y

Note that if the compilation fails with an error like:

    [ERROR]    collect2: error: ld terminated with signal 9 [Killed]
    [ERROR]    make[4]: *** [cc1] Error 1
    [ERROR]    make[3]: *** [all-gcc] Error 2

This means the virtual machine ran out of memory during the last stages of the
compilation process.  You can resolve this by bumping up the memory available to
the VM by changing this line in the Vagrantfile

    # Bump the memory allocated to the VM up to 1 gigabyte as the compilation of
    # the esp-open-sdk tools requires more memory to complete.
    v.memory = 1024

I found at least 1 gigabyte of memory was required to compile the SDK (and that
is the default configuration value).  If you change the Vagrantfile you will
need to stop and restart the VM (see the Stopping & Starting the VM section
further below).

_Windows Note: esp-open-sdk & CircuitPython utilize symbolic links to compile.
When using SMB shared folders, Windows does not allow creation of these symbolic
links.  If you plan on using the SMB shared folder setup in the Vagrantfile, you
will need to manually create the symbolic links inside the VM with folder sharing
turned off (comment out the line in the Vagrantfile).  The known links required
are listed in the Vagrant file.  Afterwards, you can turn on folder sharing again.
The links will also need to be re-created after any re-provisioning or
using `git submodule update`._

Once the ESP open SDK compilation has finished you need to extend the path
environment variable so the tools are accessible to CircuitPython and other build
scripts.  You can do this by changing the .profile file so that on every login
to the virtual machine it extends the path to includes these tools.  Do this by
executing:

    echo "PATH=$(pwd)/xtensa-lx106-elf/bin:\$PATH" >> ~/.profile

Finally exit and re-enter the VM to make this path change available by running:

    exit
    vagrant ssh

## CircuitPython Compilation

After the ESP open SDK has been compiled and added to the path, execute the
following commands to start compiling CircuitPython (the compilation is quick and
only takes a few minutes depending on the speed of your machine):

    cd ~/circuitpython/ports/esp8266
    make BOARD=feather_huzzah

After the firmware compilation finishes the output will be the file ./build/firmware-combined.bin.
This file should be flashed to the ESP8266 using any convenient flashing tool
(see Flashing ESP8266 Firmware below).  You can copy the firmware-combined.bin file
to Vagrant's shared directory so it is accessible from your main computer and
not just the Vagrant VM.  Do this by running:

    cp ./build/firmware-combined.bin /vagrant/

Now on your machine (not on the VM!) look inside the folder with the
Vagrantfile and you should see the firmware-combined.bin file.

If you make any changes to CircuitPython, like modifying the ./scripts/main.py
file to change the boards's behavior on boot, you can recompile the MicroPython
firmware by running these commands again (`make clean` erases your previous build):

    cd ~/circuitpython/ports/esp8266
    make clean; make BOARD=feather_huzzah

## Stopping & Starting the VM

To stop the VM make sure you've exited from any SSH session on it (run the `exit` 
command) and then run this command inside the directory with the Vagrantfile:

    vagrant halt

To start the VM and SSH into it again just run:

    vagrant up
    vagrant ssh

## Flashing ESP8266 Firmware

To flash the CircuitPython firmware to the ESP8266 you can use the excellent
[esptool.py](https://github.com/themadinventor/esptool) Python script.  Note that
you'll run this script from your machine and _not_ the Vagrant VM that compiled
the firmware!

First you need to make sure you have [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) 
and [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed and have the 
[PySerial library](http://pyserial.sourceforge.net/).  For Windows users 
the easiest thing to do is install the [pyserial-2.7.win32.exe installer](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyserial) 
and run it to install the library.  For Mac OSX or Linux users you can 
instead install the library by [installing pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html) 
and then running in a terminal:

    sudo pip install pyserial

Once pyserial is installed clone the esptool.py repository by running in
a terminal:

    git clone https://github.com/themadinventor/esptool.git

Then change to the directory with the esptool.py script and invoke it with the -h
option to see its usage:

    cd esptool
    python esptool.py -h

You should see something like the following printed:

    usage: esptool [-h] [--port PORT] [--baud BAUD]
               {load_ram,dump_mem,read_mem,write_mem,write_flash,run,image_info,make_image,elf2image,read_mac,flash_id,read_flash,erase_flash}
                   ...
    ...

Now to flash the ESP8266 firmware make sure your ESP8266 is connected to your
machine using a USB to serial cable.  Find the name of the serial port using
Device Manager on Windows, or running `ls -l /dev/tty*` on Mac OSX or Linux
(usually it's a device /dev/ttyUSB on Linux).

You also need to make sure you have a firmware-combined.bin file that was
built inside the VM in the previous steps.

To flash the chip with the firmware, hold down the GPIO0 button and then press
the reset button (while still holding GPIO0).  Release the reset button and then
release the GPIO0 button.  //TODO: remove since not needed on Huzzah?

Now run in the terminal:

    python esptool.py -p <serial port name> write_flash 0x00 firmware-combined.bin

Replace `<serial port name>` with the name of the serial port connected to the
ESP8266, and replace firmware-combined.bin with the path to the firmware-combined.bin
file if it is not already in the same directory.  For example to flash the chip
from a Linux machine a command like the following is run:

    python esptool.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 write_flash 0x00 firmware-combined.bin

The ESP8266 will be flashed with the MicroPython firmware and you should see output
like the following:

    Connecting...
    Erasing flash...
    Writing at 0x0004d800... (100 %)
    
    Leaving...

Congratulations you've flashed the ESP8266 with CircuitPython!  Now to test it out
connect to the ESP8266's serial port at 115200 baud.  You should see a Python REPL,
for example try typing:

    print('Hello world!')
